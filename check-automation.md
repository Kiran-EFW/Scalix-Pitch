# Automation Status Check

## Current Setup

✅ **Workflow Files Found:**
1. `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml` (Custom workflow)
2. `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml` (Auto-generated by Firebase CLI)
3. `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml` (Auto-generated by Firebase CLI)

## How to Verify Automation is Working

### Option 1: Check GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Kiran-EFW/Scalix-Pitch
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab
3. You should see workflow runs listed there
4. Check for:
   - ✅ Green checkmark = Success
   - ❌ Red X = Failed
   - 🟡 Yellow circle = In progress

### Option 2: Check Recent Deployments

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/scalix-pitch-deck/hosting
2. Check the "Deploy history" section
3. Look for recent deployments with commit messages

### Option 3: Test the Automation

Make a small change and push to trigger deployment:

```bash
# Make a small change (e.g., update a comment)
echo "# Test automation" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test automation deployment"
git push origin main
```

Then check GitHub Actions tab to see if it triggers.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Secret Name Mismatch:**
- Auto-generated workflows use: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SCALIX_PITCH_DECK`
- Custom workflow uses: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`

**Action Required:**
- Ensure the secret `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SCALIX_PITCH_DECK` exists in GitHub Secrets
- Or update the custom workflow to use the same secret name

## Recommended Workflow

The **auto-generated workflow** (`firebase-hosting-merge.yml`) is recommended because it:
- ✅ Has better file copying logic
- ✅ Handles edge cases
- ✅ Is maintained by Firebase team
- ✅ Already configured for your project

## Troubleshooting

If automation is not working:

1. **Check GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Verify `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SCALIX_PITCH_DECK` exists

2. **Check Workflow Permissions:**
   - Go to: Settings → Actions → General
   - Ensure "Workflow permissions" allows read/write

3. **Check Recent Runs:**
   - Go to: Actions tab
   - Click on failed runs to see error messages

4. **Verify Firebase Project:**
   ```bash
   firebase projects:list
   # Should show scalix-pitch-deck
   ```
